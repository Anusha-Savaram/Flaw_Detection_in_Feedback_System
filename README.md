# Flaw_Detection_in_Feedback_System
This project is an attempt to understand the flaws in the feedback system conducted by the hospital to care receivers, to understand the care givers-care receiver relationship.
We built a numerical model to understand the variability trends of burden scores using variance. 
We figured out that burden scores were not changing.
Conclusion/Reasons:
1. A patient attempts the same assessment multiple times leading to inconsistent data.
2. Even after the assessment is completed, the scores are recorded multiple times leading to lack of volatility, wasted effort and increased costs.
3. Tests are not taken seriously by the patients leading to inconsistent and wrong feedback.
4. There is a probability that few services are not provided to all the patients leading to default/wrong or null/0 marking of answers to the questions of different burden scores. This  leads to bad, inconsistent, duplicate and non-volatile data.
5. Even when the assessment is in progress the scores are recorded multiple times leading to different scores of same assessment with different time stamps. This further leads to wrong data and incorrect feedback.
6. At times the assessments are in progress even when the case is closed. Either the assessments are left mid way or its the sheer mis-management of the feedback system.
